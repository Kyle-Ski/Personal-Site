                        <p>For the past year I have been making a board game with my long time friends Matt Wilson and Mat Floerke. We were inspired by RPG games where you enter into differnet dungeons, but also by classics like Risk and Catan.</p>

                        <p>One of my ongoing self projects is to get outdoors. I call it a project because you need to be propperly prepared when camping. It also allows you to get away and reset, so your work week doesn't get too hecktic.</p>

                <h1>Likes and Hobbies</h1>
                <p>When I'm not coding or at Galvanize, you can typically find me outdoors or playing videogames.
                    I love Colorado and all it has to offer. If I have enough time I like to take extended backpacking trips
                    into the mountains. For me, getting outside is a great place to ground myself. It allows me to slow down
                    and put my problems and life into prospective. Indoors, I love to play RPG adventure games while listening 
                    to classic rock artists such as Led Zeppelin, CCR, Steve Miller, and much more. When I need to wind down and 
                    watch something I love watching Sci-Fi classics like Star Wars (origional trillogy) or fantasy masterpieces
                    such as The Lord of The Rings.
                </p>
                <h1>Etienne De Grellet</h1>
                <p>The quote I chose for my home page comes from a quaker by the name of Etienne De Grellet. This sentence is a 
                    mantra that I repeat to myself often. Not only does it remind me to treat people with humility, respect, and 
                    empathy, it also is a way of being. It is a sort of Carpe Diem for me. I will only live this day, this walk of 
                    life one time so I must do my utmost best to act in the present. Not only act in the present, but act in a good 
                    manner for my future self and the betterment of my piers.

                <h1>What I'm Doing</h1>
                <p>Recently I have been enjoying the summer by climbing a few 14er's including Mt. Massive and Democrat and doing
                    plenty of day hikes. I have also been teaching myslef how to play the guitar very slowly over the past year. It is a 
                    slow process but I have been thouroughly enjoying it. Another slow process I am currently involved in is creating a 
                    board game with a few of my friends. We are inspired by games like Risk, Settlers of Catan, and Star Craft. Currently 
                    I am a student at Galvanize in the Web Developement and am excited for what the future holds for me.
