            <h1>Likes and Hobbies</h1>
            <p>When I'm not coding or at Galvanize, you can typically find me outdoors or playing videogames.
                I love Colorado and all it has to offer. If I have enough time I like to take extended backpacking trips
                into the mountains. For me, getting outside is a great place to ground myself. It allows me to slow down
                and put my problems and life into prospective. Indoors, I love to play RPG adventure games while listening 
                to classic rock artists such as Led Zeppelin, CCR, Steve Miller, and much more. When I need to wind down and 
                watch something I love watching Sci-Fi classics like Star Wars (origional trillogy) or fantasy masterpieces
                such as The Lord of The Rings.

            <h1>Etienne De Grellet</h1>
            <p>The quote I chose for my home page comes from a quaker by the name of Etienne De Grellet. This sentence is a 
                mantra that I repeat to myself often. Not only does it remind me to treat people with humility, respect, and 
                empathy, it also is a way of being. It is a sort of Carpe Diem for me. I will only live this day, this walk of 
                life one time so I must do my utmost best to act in the present. Not only act in the present, but act in a good 
                manner for my future self and the betterment of my piers.
            </p>
